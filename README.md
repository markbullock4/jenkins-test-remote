Jenkins Example Declarative Pipeline for remote use (JCasC)

As mentioned, this is a declarative pipeline to test remote JCasC.  

NOTE: I will might add more details later or put in a separate post somewhere but here is the basics of what you need to do:

-Set up Jenkins
-Set up a plugin script to deploy remotely any Jenkins plugins needed
-Set up any specific orchestration YAML files
-Create credentials
-Create a sample pipeline (maybe try it in the GUI first?)
-Test connectivity remotely
-Test the pipeline launches remotely and succeeds 
-> DONE!
