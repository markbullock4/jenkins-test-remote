Jenkins Example Declarative Pipeline for remote use (JCasC)</br>

As mentioned, this is a declarative pipeline to test remote JCasC.  </br>

NOTE: I will might add more details later or put in a separate post somewhere but here is the basics of what you need to do:
</br>
-Set up Jenkins</br>
-Set up a plugin script to deploy remotely any Jenkins plugins needed</br>
-Set up any specific orchestration YAML files</br>
-Create credentials</br>
-Create a sample pipeline (maybe try it in the GUI first?)</br>
-Test connectivity remotely</br>
-Test the pipeline launches remotely and succeeds </br>
-> DONE!</br>
